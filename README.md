# Regularization Techniques and Variable Selection in Python

This repository features a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on regularization techniques and variable selection methods in Python. These notebooks highlight my expertise in improving model performance and preventing overfitting through regularization and careful variable selection. This repository is intended for potential employers to review my work and assess my proficiency in these advanced data science techniques.

### Notebooks Included

1. **Regularization LASSO:**
   - Detailed implementation of LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization, including its impact on model performance and variable selection.
   
2. **Regularization Ridge:**
   - Comprehensive guide to ridge regularization, demonstrating how to apply ridge penalties to linear models to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
   
3. **Regularization Data Scaling:**
   - An exploration of data scaling techniques and their importance in regularization, with practical examples to illustrate their impact on model performance.
   
4. **Variables and Variable Selection Examples:**
   - Examples of various methods for selecting important variables, including techniques for evaluating and comparing different variable selection strategies.

### Purpose

This repository is designed to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in regularization techniques and variable selection to potential employers. The notebooks include detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to provide a comprehensive understanding of each topic. By reviewing these notebooks, employers can assess my ability to:
